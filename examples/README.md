Example scripts and notebooks showing intended usage of the CLI tools and
Python library code.

Many of the notebooks also double as "Visual Tests," since many algorithms are
difficult to test for correctness automatically and many implementation errors
can be identified rapidly by the human eye. During development of algorithms
such as FastICA these notebooks should be frequently consulted and re-run as
part of the testing process.
