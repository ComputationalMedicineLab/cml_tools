Computational Medicine Lab Tools Repository (Version 2)
=======================================================

Contains public data preparation and model training code for the Computational
Medicine Lab.

The files `env_pip.sh` and `env_mkl.sh` can be sourced on a machine with
`micromamba` installed to create and configure an approprate research and
development environment in Python. Intel processors are assumed for Intel's
`MKL` library and the `KMP_*` settings in `env_mkl.sh`.
