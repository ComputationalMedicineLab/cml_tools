Computational Medicine Lab Tools Repository (Version 2)
=======================================================

Contains public data preparation and model training code for the Computational
Medicine Lab.

The `tools` directory contains useful scripts for installing a work
envrionment; see `tools/build_env.sh` for details. Our major dependencies are
numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, and pytorch. We prefer micromamba for installing
python and managing the base environment but pip for installing third-party
packages.
