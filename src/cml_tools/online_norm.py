Parallel calculation of curve statistics (mean and variance). The functions
here are capable of updating mean and variance from two datasets with
heterogeneous sets of channel labels.

Usage:
>>> # assume we have a list of curveset dataframes
>>> stats = None
>>> for df in curves:
...     stats = update(stats, to_stats(df))
>>> to_dataframe(stats)
